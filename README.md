# Smart Text-Voice Controlled PhotoAlbum

Implemented a photo album web application, that can be searched using natural language
through both text and voice. I learnt how to use Lex, ElasticSearch, and
Rekognition to create an intelligent search layer to query your photos for people,
objects, actions, landmarks and more.
